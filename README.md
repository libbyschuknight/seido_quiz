# Seido Karate Quiz

I practice [Seido Karate](http://seidowellington.co.nz/) in Wellington.

As we progress through Seido we need to learn:
* Japanese terms for techniques
* the history of Seido Karate
* meanings of kata etc

I am going to make a quiz in JavaScript that will:
1.  ask questions and check answers and output how many questions the user for correct or wrong (based on the Quiz Challenge in the Treehouse JS Loops, Arrays & Objects course)
2.  Further development down the track we be:
* asking for users name and keeping a Top Score list of users that will be displayed - maybe on another page
* telling the user if they have acheived the high score
* any other cool things for a quiz

I was thinking that this would just be for my own learning, however I have spoken with another member of my dojo and she thinks it could be something really useful to help the children in the club to learn terms and history.
